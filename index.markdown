Hi, welcome to my "WIP" website.

I'm Yuri Gardinazzi and I've just started my second year of PhD at the [University of Trieste](https://portale.units.it/it) in Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. 

I'm currently pursuing my PhD at [Area Science Park](https://www.areasciencepark.it/) under the supervision of [Matteo Biagetti](https://areasciencepark-rit.gitlab.io/lade/matteo.biagetti/).  

Our main work is focused on applications of Topological Data Analysis to Deep Learning, in particular to Large Language Models. You can find my publications [here](/publication/).
