My personal interests are pretty broad, in research they span from Complex Systems to Artificial Intelligence, and interdisciplinary approaches in general.
About AI, I'd like to improve our understanding about big models that is what I'm actually doing at the moment during my PhD. 

Topology might be an interesting tool to achieve this result and computer scientists like me know too little about it.

Moreover I'm trying to understand in my spare time about the fundamentals of intelligence and how they can be exploited in the devolpment of new models/learning algorithms.  (No AGI with so many computational resources used? There must be something that we are still missing). 

About other things, I'm interested in the general debate about where is science going at the moment, and in my spare time I'm a League of Legend player and I've started to practice Calisthenics, I'll keep this website updated if I'll break myself.
